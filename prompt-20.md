# Session 20: Converting to a Single-Player Game

## Session Goals
For this session, we'll focus on converting FoodFight into a purely single-player experience by fully implementing the AI opponent and removing the two-player mode. This will streamline the gameplay experience and development focus.

## Background from Previous Session
In Session 19, we completed a major code cleanup where we:
- Removed defensive programming patterns across multiple files
- Eliminated asynchronous code that was masking execution order issues
- Treated the application as properly synchronous with guaranteed component initialization
- Simplified error handling and complex fallback mechanisms
- Improved overall code clarity by removing redundant checks and debug prints

## Tasks for Session 20

### 1. Remove Two-Player Mode Components
- Modify the game state machine to only handle human vs. AI flow
- Remove player 2 input handlers from relevant scenes
- Update UI elements that reference "Player 2" to show "AI Opponent" instead
- Remove player name input for Player 2 from start screen/UI

### 2. Enhance AI Implementation
- Ensure AI components can properly replace all Player 2 functions
- Complete implementation of AI decision-making for placement and targeting phases
- Add difficulty options for the AI if not already present
- Make sure the AI controller properly integrates with the game state machine

### 3. Update Game Flow
- Modify turn transitions to automatically handle AI turns
- Implement visual feedback for when AI is "thinking" 
- Ensure game phases transition correctly between human player and AI
- Update victory/defeat conditions to reflect single-player context

### 4. UI and Feedback Enhancements
- Add UI indicators showing the AI is taking its turn
- Possibly add "thought bubbles" or other visual elements to show AI decision-making
- Update any instructions or help text to reflect single-player mode

## Approach
We'll start by identifying all places in the code that handle two-player functionality, then methodically update each component to exclusively support a human player vs. AI opponent. We'll leverage the architectural improvements from our cleanup session, particularly the separation of AI controller logic from the main game state machine.

With our cleaner codebase from Session 19, we should be able to make these focused changes without introducing bugs from tangled dependencies.
