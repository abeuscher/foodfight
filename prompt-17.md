# Session Prompt: Refining the Damage System in FoodFight

## Current Implementation Status
In the previous session, we successfully implemented the foundation for our damage system:

1. **Core Mechanics Implemented:**
   - Added health properties to different weapon types (100 for bases, 15-30 for other structures)
   - Implemented defensive bonuses from defensive structures
   - Added damage calculation with defensive protection
   - Connected attack logic to health reduction

2. **Visual Systems:**
   - Confirmed health bars are displaying above structures
   - Observed at least one health bar changing during testing
   - Implemented impact visualization on the game board

3. **Current Issues:**
   - Health bar updates are inconsistent - only some bars update when damage is applied
   - The damage numbers may not be appearing correctly
   - Debug information suggests damage calculations are working but visual feedback is incomplete

## Goals for Next Session

1. **Fix Visual Feedback:**
   - Ensure all health bars update properly when structures take damage
   - Add clearer damage numbers floating above damaged structures
   - Implement color transitions for health bars (green → yellow → red)

2. **Enhance Destruction Effects:**
   - Add visual effects when a structure is destroyed
   - Ensure proper cleanup of destroyed structures
   - Add animation/particles for structure destruction

3. **Improve Debugging:**
   - Add more detailed logging for damage calculation and application
   - Create a debug overlay to show structure health values during testing
   - Track and display defensive bonuses more clearly

4. **Balance and Testing:**
   - Test multiple attack scenarios to verify damage calculation
   - Test structure destruction and game-over conditions
   - Adjust damage values and health for game balance

## Technical Investigation Points

1. **Health Bar Updates:**
   - Investigate why some health bars update while others don't
   - Check if instance_id generation is consistent between creation and updates
   - Verify the update_health_bar method is being called with correct parameters

2. **Damage Visualization:**
   - Debug the show_impact method to ensure it's creating damage indicators
   - Check if impact effects are visible and positioned correctly
   - Verify the timing and duration of visual effects

3. **Structure Destruction:**
   - Test the flow from damage application to structure removal
   - Verify the remove_weapon_from_board method is called when health reaches zero
   - Ensure game state is updated correctly after structure destruction

The priority for the next session should be to get the visual feedback working properly, ensuring players can clearly see the damage being dealt to structures and the resulting health changes. This will complete our minimum viable damage system, after which we can focus on polish and balancing.
