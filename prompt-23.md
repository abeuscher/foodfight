# Session 23: Completing AI Game Loop Integration

## Progress from Session 22
In Session 22, we successfully refactored the UI management system to improve code organization and maintainability:

1. Split `base_ui_manager.gd` into six specialized components:
   - `base_ui_manager.gd`: Core UI coordinator
   - `player_ui_manager.gd`: Player name and ingredients display
   - `phase_ui_manager.gd`: Game phase transitions and labels
   - `placement_ui_manager.gd`: Base and weapon placement UI
   - `targeting_ui_manager.gd`: Targeting phase UI
   - `ai_ui_manager.gd`: AI-specific UI elements

2. Restructured the directory organization:
   - Created a dedicated `scripts/ui/` directory for UI components
   - Moved AI-specific UI to `scripts/ai/` directory

3. Updated signal connections to work with the new UI structure:
   - Modified AI opponent to connect signals directly
   - Updated GameManager and GameStateMachine to handle the new UI components

4. Fixed several initialization and reference issues:
   - Ensured proper component initialization order
   - Updated component dependencies in GameManager

The game now has a much cleaner UI management system with better separation of concerns, making future UI changes easier to implement.

## Tasks for Session 23: Completing AI Game Loop Integration

### 1. Implement AI Weapon Placement
- Debug and complete AI weapon placement logic
- Ensure proper selection and positioning of weapons
- Handle resource management for AI player

### 2. Fix Targeting Phase Transitions
- Complete targeting phase UI and interaction for player
- Implement AI targeting decision making
- Ensure proper transitions between player and AI turns

### 3. Finalize Attack Resolution
- Complete attack resolution phase for both players
- Implement damage calculation and visual feedback
- Handle base destruction and victory conditions

### 4. Complete Game Loop
- Ensure the game properly cycles through all phases
- Implement proper round transitions
- Add end-game detection and restart functionality

### 5. Final Testing and Polishing
- Test the complete game loop with AI opponent
- Balance AI difficulty if needed
- Add final polish to game state transitions and feedback

## Approach
Building on our refactored UI system, we'll now focus on completing the AI gameplay systems to create a functional game loop. We'll prioritize making the single-player experience engaging and challenging, with clear feedback at each step of the game.

We'll start by testing the current state of the AI weapon placement to identify and fix any issues, then move on to ensuring the targeting phase works correctly with proper turn transitions. Finally, we'll implement the attack resolution and victory conditions to complete the game loop.

Throughout this session, we'll ensure that the AI provides appropriate visual feedback through our newly refactored UI system, and that all game states transition correctly as players (human and AI) take their turns.
