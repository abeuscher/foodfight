# Sprint 2 | Phase 1: Fixing Weapon Placement Completion

## Current Progress
We've made significant progress on the game loop initialization issues:

1. We fixed the issue with `PhaseUIManager` not being properly initialized by:
   - Adding `get_weapon_by_type()` to weapon_types.gd
   - Modifying phase_manager to use event-based communication instead of direct method calls
   - Ensuring UI components are consistently registered as services

2. Current state:
   - Player can now correctly place their base
   - Player can proceed to the weapon placement phase
   - Player can select and place weapons

## Current Issue
When the player presses the "End Placement" button during the weapon placement phase, the game crashes with this error:
