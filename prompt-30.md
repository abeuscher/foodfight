## FoodFight Game Phase Transition Bug - ServiceInitializer & UI Issues

I'm working on a Godot 4 game called FoodFight. We've been implementing a service registration pattern with an event system for improved component communication, but we've encountered several related bugs that prevent the game from properly advancing through its phases.

### Main Issue
The game gets stuck after base placement phase - it doesn't properly transition to the weapon placement phase. When the base placement is completed, the UI sometimes doesn't update correctly.

### Context
We're using a service locator pattern where components register themselves with a central GameManager. We've implemented:
1. A `ServiceInitializer` that ensures critical services are registered
2. A `NullService` pattern as a fallback for missing services
3. An event-based UI system with `BaseUIListener` for decoupling
4. A recovery helper to fix broken services at runtime

### Specific Problems

1. `PhaseUIManager` is sometimes registered as a `NullService` instead of a real instance
2. Stack overflow errors in `BaseUIManager` when certain methods call each other recursively
3. Game incorrectly ends during base placement phase instead of advancing
4. UI doesn't properly update when game state changes
5. Service initialization ordering issues

### Current Progress

We've made several fixes:
1. Added missing methods to `NullService` to avoid crashes
2. Implemented a `ServiceInitializer` to ensure services are properly registered
3. Fixed a stack overflow in `BaseUIManager`
4. Added a recovery helper to fix broken services at runtime
5. Added better debug output for service registration

But the game still doesn't advance properly through phases.

Can you help me finish debugging this issue? The key is to make the game correctly transition from base placement to weapon placement phase.
