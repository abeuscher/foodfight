Please find the attached project description and a couple of session prompts. One of them was cut off during its generation and then I lost connection with the LLM I was working with so it only has partial information about what we got done in the last session. The first issue we want to do is address the fact that the AI's base placement turn never seems to occur. 

This code has problems that need fixing. Please see the coding guideleines for more information on how to work with files.

Please error toward producing fewer lines of code where possible. The longer the code gets the worse the quality is. And the longer it takes to process for you. 

Please let me know of questions.

In this session, I do NOT want you to try and generate a version of any code that you haven't seen. Do not try and guess what any of my code says. The project description contains a lot of information about the file structure and function of this app. Use it to ask for more context if you need it.

Okay the main error persists - the AI's turn is being skipped.

I am adding a lot of the files that control the ai and the game flow. Please look through them. Again - the main error is that the game never goes to the ai'ss turn. It is probably that we have a bad signal system or a something is not registering as a serrvice that should be, or we have multiple competing systems. I think it is probably the latter; we have remnants of multiple systems that are conflicting with each other but not throwing erros.

It is critical that you understand that I do not care about backwards compativility at all. When I say less code - I mean remove unused fubnctions and variables as much as possible, not to make minimal changes.
