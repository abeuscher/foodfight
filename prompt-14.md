# Session Prompt: Implementing Interstitial Screens Between Game Phases

## Summary of Progress
We've successfully implemented the core game loop with distinct phases:
1. BASE_PLACEMENT - One-time phase where each player places their base
2. WEAPON_PLACEMENT - Players place offensive/defensive weapons
3. TARGETING - Players select targets to attack
4. ATTACK - Visual representation of attacks and damage calculation
5. RESOLUTION - Checking victory conditions and transitioning to next round

We've also enhanced the attack visualization, implemented a damage system, and added clear visual feedback for each phase in the game.

## Goals for Next Session
1. Add interstitial screens between game phases that announce upcoming phases
2. Create a reusable interstitial screen implementation
3. Integrate the screens into the existing game flow
4. Add appropriate timing and transitions between phases

## Key Requirements
- Interstitial screens should clearly indicate the upcoming phase
- Screens should appear between all major phase transitions
- The system should be flexible enough to add custom messaging or visuals
- Transitions should feel smooth and professional

## Important Files
- game_state_machine.gd - For handling phase transitions
- Main UI - For displaying the interstitial screens
- base_ui_manager.gd - For managing UI elements

## Development Guidelines
1. Do not give any code partials that are longer than 5 lines. If your rewrite is longer than 5 lines, provide the whole file.
2. Never try to rewrite code you haven't seen the most recent version of. When in doubt, ask questions.
3. Maintain consistent coordinate systems and UI patterns.
4. Use a phased approach for implementation, verifying each step works before proceeding.

I'd like to implement a clean, elegant solution for the interstitial screens that fits well with our existing architecture. Let's start by designing the interstitial screen system and then integrating it into our phase transition logic.
