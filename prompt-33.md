# Prompt-33: Completing the Game Loop Refactoring

## Progress So Far
We've implemented a proper phase management system by:
- Creating a dedicated `phase_manager.gd` to centralize phase transitions
- Refactoring components to follow the Service Locator pattern
- Adding proper null checks and fallbacks when accessing services
- Fixing initialization issues with redundant phase manager instances

## Current Issues
We've resolved recursive base placement loops, but weapon placement buttons still don't function. We need to:

1. Fix redundant phase transition calls:
   - Several components are still calling phase transitions directly
   - Many components bypass the PhaseManager service

2. Address service initialization timing:
   - Ensure phase_manager is registered first, before other components need it
   - Ensure UI components update only after state transitions complete

3. Fix button functionality:
   - Properly connect button signals in the weapon placement phase
   - Ensure events are properly propagated

## Next Steps
1. Audit all files for direct phase transitions not using the Service Locator pattern
2. Fix signal connection issues between weapon buttons and handlers
3. Ensure proper initialization sequence with phase_manager first
4. Complete the game loop through weapon placement, targeting, and attack phases

The main guideline is to eliminate any code that bypasses the Service Locator pattern or creates redundant state transitions.

## Files to Review in Next Phase

1. **phase_manager.gd** - Our centralized phase controller, already refactored but may need fine-tuning for proper weapon phase handling

2. **weapon_placement.gd** - Handles weapon placement logic; check for improper service access and event connections

3. **placement_state.gd** - Manages weapon buttons and UI state; verify button signal connections

4. **game_state_machine.gd** - May have redundant phase transition logic that bypasses phase_manager

5. **main.gd** - Verify initialization sequence ensures phase_manager is available before other components

6. **event_bus.gd** (if it exists) - Check event subscription/handling for weapon placement events

7. **base_ui_manager.gd** - Inspect UI update logic for weapon buttons visibility and functionality

8. **weapon_types.gd** - Ensure proper weapon data is available for placement and buttons

9. **game_board.gd** - Check placement validation logic when clicking weapon buttons

Focus on:
- Eliminating duplicate service lookups
- Ensuring proper signal connections for button presses
- Verifying event flow follows service locator pattern
- Fixing initialization order issues
- Addressing any component bypassing phase_manager

The core issue appears to be synchronization between UI components and game state transitions during weapon placement phase.
