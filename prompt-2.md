Here's a summary of what we've accomplished in this session:

## Updated Context for FoodFight Project

### Game Concept
- 2-player turn-based strategy game (eventually player vs. computer)
- Grid-based board with two islands separated by water
- Food-themed weapons and defenses (ice cream catapults, cream puff bombs, etc.)
- Non-violent, lighthearted approach
- Turn structure: placement phase → simultaneous attack phase → scoring
- Win condition: opponent loses ability to attack

```

### Development Progress
- Basic Godot project structure established with organized folders
- Created GameBoard scene with grid initialization
- Set up terrain types (land and water) with visual representation
- Implemented Main scene with game state management
- Established turn-based flow structure
- Added start screen with player name input
- Implemented global game data with singleton pattern
- Added UI elements to show current player and game phase

### Current Implementation
- Grid system with 16x8 cells (64x64 pixels each)
- Middle section automatically set as water, edges as land
- Basic game state machine (setup, placement, attack, resolution)
- Functions for grid-to-world coordinate conversion
- Visual rendering of the grid with appropriate colors
- Player name input on start screen
- Data passing between scenes using singleton pattern
- Basic UI showing game state and current player

### New Components
1. **Start Screen**:
   - UI scene with input fields for player names
   - Start button to begin the game
   - Script to handle input and scene transitions

2. **Game Data Singleton**:
   - Global access point for shared game data
   - Stores player names and other game settings
   - Accessible from any script using `GameData`

3. **UI Updates**:
   - Added UI elements to main scene
   - Display current player and game phase
   - Update dynamically during gameplay

### Next Steps
1. Enhance the start screen visual style using Godot's theming system
2. Implement player input for weapon placement
3. Create basic weapon types and their functionality
4. Develop targeting system for weapons
5. Build attack phase logic
6. Implement win condition detection
7. Refine UI elements for game control

The next focus will be on applying basic styles to the start screen to get a feel for working with Godot's UI system in a text-based workflow rather than primarily using the GUI editor.
