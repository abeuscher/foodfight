# Sprint 01: UI System Refactoring

## Sprint Overview

This sprint focuses on refactoring the UI system in Food Fight to create a more maintainable, decoupled architecture using service locator and event-based patterns. The work has been divided into five phases, with each phase to be completed in a separate session.

## Development Approach

Each session will focus on implementing and testing one phase of the refactoring work. This step-by-step approach allows us to:

1. Implement changes incrementally
2. Test each phase independently
3. Identify and fix issues early 
4. Build a solid foundation for subsequent phases
5. Maintain a working game throughout the refactoring process

## Sprint Phases

### Phase 1: Service Locator Implementation (Session 25)
- Enhance GameManager with service registration and retrieval functionality
- Create mechanisms for component access via the service locator
- Implement basic error handling for service access
- Begin converting direct references to service-based access

### Phase 2: Initialization Sequence Improvement (Session 26)
- Reorganize initialization to have clear, sequential stages
- Implement dependency checking between components
- Create a more robust startup sequence
- Ensure proper error handling during initialization

### Phase 3: Event System Implementation (Session 27)
- Add a central event bus for UI and game state communications
- Convert direct method calls to event-based communications
- Implement event handlers in UI components
- Create standardized event naming and parameter conventions

### Phase 4: UI Component Integration (Session 28)
- Ensure all UI managers use the event system properly
- Complete the decoupling of UI components
- Create a consistent interface for UI updates
- Implement safety mechanisms for missing components

### Phase 5: Visualization and Flow Fixes (Session 29)
- Address issues with weapon previews
- Fix phase transitions and game flow
- Enhance AI turn reliability
- Implement comprehensive testing for all game phases

## Sprint Review (Session 30)

At the conclusion of this sprint, we will:

1. **Review the Implementation**:
   - Evaluate if all phases were completed successfully
   - Test the entire game flow to identify any remaining issues
   - Verify that all UI components function correctly

2. **Address Technical Debt**:
   - Identify any shortcuts or workarounds that need proper implementation
   - Document architecture decisions for future reference

3. **Retrospective**:
   - What worked well in this sprint?
   - What could be improved in our development process?
   - Were our phases appropriately sized and scoped?

4. **Plan Next Sprint**:
   - Based on the current state of the project, identify priorities for the next sprint
   - Break down the next set of features/refactors into phases
   - Create a new sprint prompt document with detailed plans

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this sprint, we should have:

1. A more maintainable UI architecture using service locator and event patterns
2. Clear component initialization and dependency management
3. More reliable game flow and phase transitions
4. Improved error handling throughout the system
5. A solid foundation for future enhancements

This phased approach ensures we can make significant architectural improvements while maintaining a functioning game throughout the process.
