## Updated Context for Next Session

### Game Concept
- 2-player turn-based strategy game (eventually player vs. computer)
- Grid-based board with two islands separated by water
- Food-themed weapons and defenses (ice cream catapults, cream puff bombs, etc.)
- Non-violent, lighthearted approach
- Turn structure: placement phase → simultaneous attack phase → scoring
- Win condition: opponent loses ability to attack

### Development Progress
- Basic Godot project structure established with organized folders
- Created GameBoard scene with grid initialization
- Set up terrain types (land and water) with visual representation
- Implemented Main scene with game state management
- Established turn-based flow structure

### Current Implementation
- Grid system with 16x8 cells (64x64 pixels each)
- Middle section automatically set as water, edges as land
- Basic game state machine (setup, placement, attack, resolution)
- Functions for grid-to-world coordinate conversion
- Visual rendering of the grid with appropriate colors

### Next Steps
1. Implement player input for weapon placement
2. Create basic weapon types and their functionality
3. Develop targeting system for weapons
4. Build attack phase logic
5. Implement win condition detection
6. Add basic UI elements for game control
