# FoodFight Project Summary

## Game Concept
- A 2-player turn-based strategy game (with plans for player vs. computer)
- Grid-based board featuring two islands separated by water
- Food-themed weapons and defenses (ice cream catapults, cream puff bombs, etc.)
- Non-violent, lighthearted approach to combat
- Turn structure: placement phase → simultaneous attack phase → scoring
- Win condition: opponent loses ability to attack

## Current Implementation Progress
- **Start Screen**: Created a themed UI for player name input with styled components
- **Theme System**: Implemented a reusable theme resource for consistent UI styling
- **Game Data**: Set up a singleton pattern for sharing data between scenes
- **Game Board**: Created a 22×12 grid with two 10×10 islands separated by water
- **Game State**: Implemented basic state machine (setup, placement, attack, resolution)
- **UI Framework**: Added top bar with player names and scores
- **Data Flow**: Successfully passing player names from start screen to main game

## Technical Details
- Grid system: 22×12 cells (64×64 pixels each)
- Island layout: Two 10×10 land masses with a 2-cell wide water canal between them
- Visual styling: Custom theme with food-themed colors (orange/gold buttons, teal backgrounds)
- Game state management: State machine in the main script
- Data structure: Cell-based grid with terrain type and occupancy tracking

## Development Approach
We're taking a methodical, file-by-file approach to development rather than making sweeping changes across multiple files simultaneously. This helps maintain code clarity and ensures that each component works correctly before moving to the next one.

## Next Steps
The next phase of development will focus on implementing the weapon placement functionality:

1. Creating weapon types with different properties
2. Designing the GUI for weapon selection and placement
3. Implementing the placement logic to allow players to position weapons on their islands
4. Adding validation to ensure weapons are only placed on valid terrain
5. Creating the turn-based flow for the placement phase

This will require us to expand the grid cell structure to handle placed weapons and implement the UI elements needed for weapon selection and placement.
