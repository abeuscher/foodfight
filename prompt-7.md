# FoodFight Project: Implementing Targeting System

## Project Overview
FoodFight is a 2-player turn-based strategy game built in Godot where players place food-themed weapons on their respective islands and attack the enemy's forces. The game features a grid-based board with two islands separated by water.

## Current Implementation
- Grid-based game board with visual representation
- Complete placement phase where players position weapons on their islands
- Core state machine with proper transitions between game phases
- Basic attack phase mechanics with automated resolution
- Centralized initialization system using a GameManager singleton

## Progress So Far
- We've implemented a robust singleton-based initialization system
- Fixed issues with script loading and attachment
- Connected signals between components
- Placement phase is working correctly
- Attack phase is implemented but targeting system is incomplete

## Next Steps: Targeting System Implementation
Now that our codebase is well-organized with proper initialization, we need to integrate the targeting system into the gameplay flow. The targeting system should:

1. Allow players to select weapons to attack with
2. Display valid target areas based on weapon range
3. Enable players to select targets
4. Execute attacks based on chosen targets
5. Visualize attacks with appropriate effects

## Important Instructions for Implementation:
1. **DO NOT** try to rewrite files that you haven't seen yet. Always ask to see the current version of a file before suggesting changes.
2. **DO NOT** guess what might be in a file - ask to see it first.
3. Only provide partial code snippets if they are under 5 lines long and only need to be pasted into one specific location. For anything more complex, provide the complete file.
4. Focus on integrating the targeting system with the existing game flow.

Let's start by examining the targeting_manager.gd and targeting_visualization.gd files to understand their current implementation, then work on integrating them into the placement phase of the game.
