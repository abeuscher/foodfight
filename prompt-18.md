# Session Prompt: Implementing AI Opponent in FoodFight

## Progress to Date

Over the past sessions, we've built a solid foundation for our turn-based food fight game:

1. **Core Gameplay Loop**
   - Implemented complete turn-based flow with base/weapon placement, targeting, and attack phases
   - Created visual feedback for player actions including damage numbers and health bars
   - Established a balanced damage system with defensive bonuses

2. **Resource System**
   - Consolidated the scoring and resource system into a unified "ingredients" mechanic
   - Implemented a reward system where dealing damage earns ingredients (0.25 ingredients per damage point, minimum 1)
   - Created resource costs for different weapon types and balanced their stats

3. **UI and Visuals**
   - Built interactive placement and targeting interfaces
   - Added animations for attacks and health changes
   - Created phase transition screens

## Current Implementation Status

Our game is currently functional for two human players, alternating turns with clear visual feedback. The unified ingredients system has simplified game economics, and the targeting/attack system provides satisfying feedback when landing hits.

Key features implemented:
- Health bars with color transitions based on damage
- Floating damage numbers
- Multi-cell structure support
- Ingredient accumulation
- Base destruction win condition

## Goals for Next Session: AI Opponent

For the next session, we'll focus on implementing a computer opponent to replace Player 2, enabling single-player gameplay.

We'll keep the initial implementation straightforward while ensuring the architecture allows for future enhancements like difficulty levels, adaptive strategies, and specialized behaviors.

## Questions to Consider

1. How should we indicate to the player that the AI is "thinking"?
2. What UI elements should we add to support single-player mode?

The goal is to create an engaging single-player experience that maintains the strategic depth of the multiplayer mode while providing appropriate challenge for players of different skill levels.
