I'll combine the original prompt with the new game framework I created. Here's the merged content:

# FoodFight Project: Implementing Targeting System

## Project Overview
FoodFight is a 2-player turn-based strategy game built in Godot where players place food-themed weapons on their respective islands and attack the enemy's forces. The game features a grid-based board with two islands separated by water.

## Current Implementation
- Grid-based game board with visual representation
- Complete placement phase where players position weapons on their islands
- Core state machine with proper transitions between game phases
- Basic attack phase mechanics with automated resolution
- Centralized initialization system using a GameManager singleton

## Progress So Far
- We've implemented a robust singleton-based initialization system
- Fixed issues with script loading and attachment
- Connected signals between components
- Placement phase is working correctly
- Attack phase is implemented but targeting system is incomplete

## Next Steps: Targeting System Implementation
Now that our codebase is well-organized with proper initialization, we need to integrate the targeting system into the gameplay flow. The targeting system should:

1. Allow players to select weapons to attack with
2. Display valid target areas based on weapon range
3. Enable players to select targets
4. Execute attacks based on chosen targets
5. Visualize attacks with appropriate effects

## Important Instructions for Implementation:
1. **DO NOT** try to rewrite files that you haven't seen yet. Always ask to see the current version of a file before suggesting changes.
2. **DO NOT** guess what might be in a file - ask to see it first.
3. Only provide partial code snippets if they are under 5 lines long and only need to be pasted into one specific location. For anything more complex, provide the complete file.
4. Focus on integrating the targeting system with the existing game flow.

# FoodFight Core Game Framework

## Game Modes
- Single-player: Player vs. AI opponent
- Two-player: Two human players (local)

## Fundamental Game Loop

### 1. Setup Phase
- Both islands are initialized with 3 Base structures per player
- Players receive starting resources

### 2. Resource & Build Phase
- Players collect resources based on their production structures
- Players place new structures or upgrade existing ones on their island
- Building options limited by available resources and grid space
- AI makes strategic decisions in single-player mode

### 3. Targeting Phase
- Player selects up to 3 offensive weapons to deploy
- Player assigns targets on the enemy island
- Targeting interface shows weapon range, damage patterns, and valid cells
- In two-player mode, players take turns planning attacks
- In single-player mode, AI determines its targets while player is targeting

### 4. Attack Resolution Phase
- Attacks are visualized with appropriate effects
- Defensive structures attempt to intercept incoming attacks
- Damage is calculated and applied to structures
- Destroyed structures are removed from the board

### 5. Turn Transition
- Victory check: If all enemy Bases are destroyed, current player wins
- Otherwise, return to Resource & Build Phase

## Core Mechanics

### Structure Categories
- **Bases**: Primary objective structures (game ends when all are destroyed)
- **Offensive**: Various attack options with different ranges, damage patterns, and costs
- **Defensive**: Intercept incoming attacks or damage attacking units
- **Production**: Generate resources each turn
- **Support**: Enhance effectiveness of other structures

### Resource System
- **Building Resources**: For constructing and upgrading structures
- **Energy**: Required for launching attacks and activating special abilities

### Targeting System
- Line-of-sight calculations for valid targets
- Range limitations based on weapon type
- Preview damage areas before confirming attack
- Limited attacks per turn (maximum 3)

### Defensive System
- Chance-based interception system
- Interception chance affected by defensive upgrades
- Strategic placement of defenses to protect critical structures

## AI Framework (Single-player)
- Difficulty levels affecting AI decision-making
- Strategic evaluation of player's island to determine optimal targets
- Adaptive defense placement based on player's attack patterns
- Resource management prioritizing critical structures

## Visual Feedback
- Clear indication of current game phase
- Highlighting of selected weapons and valid target areas
- Attack trajectories and impact visualization
- Damage indicators and structure health status

Let's start by examining the targeting_manager.gd and targeting_visualization.gd files to understand their current implementation, then work on integrating them into the placement phase of the game.
