# Session 22: UI Manager Refactoring & Session 23: Completing AI Game Loop Integration

## Progress from Session 21
In Session 21, we made significant progress fixing core issues with the single-player experience:

1. Fixed parameter order in AI opponent code for `place_weapon()` function calls
2. Added bounds checking to prevent crashes during AI base placement
3. Corrected a critical mismatch between GameState enums across different files
4. Modified game state transitions to include explicit UI updates
5. Enhanced the UI manager to correctly handle different game states
6. Successfully implemented AI base placement functionality
7. Fixed state transition from BASE_PLACEMENT to WEAPON_PLACEMENT

The game now properly:
- Shows base placement UI for Player 1 turn
- Correctly handles AI base placement
- Transitions to weapon placement phase

However, we still have issues to address:
- The base_ui_manager.gd file is too large and complex
- The AI weapon placement phase needs implementation
- The targeting phase doesn't transition properly
- The complete game loop with AI isn't fully functional yet

## Tasks for Session 22: UI Manager Refactoring

### 1. Split base_ui_manager.gd into Smaller Components
- Identify logical groupings of functionality within the UI manager
- Create separate component scripts for each group:
  - `base_ui_manager.gd`: Core UI functionality and common utilities
  - `placement_ui_manager.gd`: Base and weapon placement UI
  - `targeting_ui_manager.gd`: Targeting phase UI
  - `ai_ui_manager.gd`: AI-specific UI elements and indicators

### 2. Implement Dependency Management Between Components
- Create a clear hierarchy of UI components
- Ensure proper signal connections between components
- Maintain a single source of truth for game state

### 3. Refactor State Management
- Improve how UI components respond to state changes
- Ensure each component only handles its specific responsibilities
- Add more robust error handling and state validation

### 4. Testing and Bug Fixes
- Test all game phases with the refactored UI components
- Ensure proper UI updates during all state transitions
- Fix any regression bugs from refactoring

## Tasks for Session 23: Completing AI Game Loop Integration

### 1. Implement AI Weapon Placement
- Debug and complete AI weapon placement logic
- Ensure proper selection and positioning of weapons
- Handle resource management for AI player

### 2. Fix Targeting Phase Transitions
- Complete targeting phase UI and interaction for player
- Implement AI targeting decision making
- Ensure proper transitions between player and AI turns

### 3. Finalize Attack Resolution
- Complete attack resolution phase for both players
- Implement damage calculation and visual feedback
- Handle base destruction and victory conditions

### 4. Complete Game Loop
- Ensure the game properly cycles through all phases
- Implement proper round transitions
- Add end-game detection and restart functionality

### 5. Final Testing and Polishing
- Test the complete game loop with AI opponent
- Balance AI difficulty if needed
- Add final polish to game state transitions and feedback

## Approach
For Session 22, we'll focus on breaking down the UI manager into more manageable pieces while maintaining functionality. We'll refactor one component at a time, testing as we go.

For Session 23, we'll build on our refactored UI system to complete the AI gameplay systems, focusing on making a complete and functional game loop.
