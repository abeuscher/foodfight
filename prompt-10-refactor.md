# Godot Game Code Refactoring: Removing Excessive Defensive Programming

I need help refactoring my Godot game code to remove excessive defensive programming patterns. My game, "FoodFight," is a turn-based strategy game with a state machine architecture that has become difficult to work with due to excessive null checks, has_method() calls, and redundant verifications.

## Component Dependency Map

```
GameManager (Singleton)
├─ Initializes & References → GameBoard
├─ Initializes & References → GameStateMachine
├─ Initializes & References → GameUIManager
├─ Initializes & References → PlayerManager
├─ Initializes & References → PlacementState
├─ Initializes & References → TargetingState
├─ Initializes & References → AttackState
├─ Initializes & References → WeaponTypes
├─ Initializes & References → WeaponPlacement
├─ Initializes & References → TargetingVisualization
├─ References → WeaponManager (via AttackState)
└─ References → TargetingManager (via AttackState)

Main (Scene Root)
├─ Calls → GameManager.initialize_game()
├─ Updates UI based on → GameStateMachine.current_state
├─ Forwards Input to → TargetingState, PlacementState
├─ Creates UI for → TargetingState
└─ Listens to signals from → TargetingState

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Remove Unnecessary Checks**:
   - Eliminate redundant null checks after initialization
   - Remove repeated has_method() checks
   - Replace complex initialization sequences with simpler patterns

2. **Standardize Component Interfaces**:
   - Create consistent method signatures across components
   - Use typed signals where possible
   - Adopt uniform initialization patterns

3. **Leverage Godot's Node System Better**:
   - Use @onready annotations consistently
   - Replace manual node references with Godot's node paths
   - Use node groups for related components

4. **Simplify Signal Connections**:
   - Remove duplicate signal connections
   - Consolidate signal connection code
   - Replace signals with direct calls where appropriate

## Files to Focus On (in order)

1. `scripts/states/game_manager.gd` - Has the most excessive checking
2. `scripts/states/targeting_state.gd` - Key for gameplay, has redundant checks
3. `scripts/states/attack_state.gd` - Another core component with excessive checks

## Specific Issues to Address

1. **In game_manager.gd**:
   - Simplify the multi-stage initialization process
   - Remove redundant script checks
   - Consolidate duplicate signal connections

2. **In targeting_state.gd**:
   - Remove redundant initialization checks
   - Simplify the player turn handling
   - Standardize signal connections

3. **In attack_state.gd**:
   - Clean up unnecessary component existence checks
   - Simplify the damage calculation logic
   - Improve error handling approach

Please start by analyzing game_manager.gd and suggest specific changes to reduce complexity while maintaining functionality. Show before/after examples of key sections to demonstrate the improvement.
