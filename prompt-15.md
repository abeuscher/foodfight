# Session Prompt: Implementing Unit Testing for FoodFight Game

## Summary of Progress
We've successfully implemented the core game loop with distinct phases:
1. BASE_PLACEMENT - One-time phase where each player places their base
2. WEAPON_PLACEMENT - Players place offensive/defensive weapons
3. TARGETING - Players select targets to attack
4. ATTACK - Visual representation of attacks and damage calculation
5. RESOLUTION - Checking victory conditions and transitioning to next round

We've enhanced the game with interstitial screens that appear between phase transitions, providing clear visual feedback to players about the upcoming phase. We've also streamlined the codebase by removing defensive checks throughout the architecture, resulting in cleaner, more direct code that aligns with the game's synchronous, monolithic design.

## Goals for Next Session
1. Discuss and explore unit testing strategies for a Godot game
2. Evaluate testing frameworks or approaches compatible with our project
3. Identify key components and functionality to prioritize for testing
4. Implement initial tests for core game logic
5. Set up a testing framework that can be expanded as development continues

## Key Areas to Consider for Testing
- Game state transitions and phase logic
- Weapon placement validation
- Targeting and attack resolution
- Damage calculation and victory conditions
- Component initialization and dependency management

## Development Guidelines
1. Begin with a discussion of testing approaches in Godot
2. Consider how to test game logic separately from UI/visual components
3. Prioritize tests for the most critical game mechanics
4. Aim for a balance between test coverage and development efficiency
5. Design tests that will help catch regressions during future development

This session will focus on establishing a solid foundation for unit testing in our game, starting with exploration of testing strategies and then implementing initial tests for core functionality.
