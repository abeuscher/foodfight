# Food Fight Game Development Progress Report

## Recent Accomplishments
- Fixed the player 2 turn skipping issue by removing duplicate signal connections in the targeting button handling
- Fixed particle effects in the attack visualization by updating the CPUParticles2D properties to use initial_velocity_min and initial_velocity_max instead of initial_velocity
- Successfully reparented the TargetingVisualization node to be a child of the GameBoard, which allows for proper coordinate space alignment
- Updated GameManager to properly find the TargetingVisualization in its new location
- Simplified the targeting visualization by removing extra visual effects to focus on core gameplay
- Established a working game loop where both players can complete their targeting turns

## Current Issues
- The targeting overlay still has alignment issues - the highlighted cells don't perfectly match up with the game grid
- Attack visualization works correctly (connecting weapon centers to target centers), but the initial targeting selection is misaligned
- No damage is being applied to weapons when they're attacked - we need to implement this to complete the combat loop

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Targeting Alignment Issues**
   - Investigate and fix the coordinate calculation in the targeting overlay
   - Ensure that mouse hover positions correctly align with grid cells
   - Make sure all coordinate transformations account for the reparented node structure

2. **Implement Weapon Damage System**
   - Create a system for weapons to take damage when hit
   - Update the health display for weapons
   - Implement weapon destruction when health reaches zero
   - Add visual feedback for damaged weapons

3. **Refine Game Loop**
   - Ensure the game properly cycles through all phases
   - Add condition checking for game end (when all bases are destroyed)
   - Improve the player feedback during each phase

## Key Findings
- The coordinate space issue appears to be related to how grid coordinates are translated to world coordinates
- Reparenting the visualization node helps with alignment but doesn't completely solve it
- The game's component architecture is working well, but we need to ensure proper initialization order and reference handling

For our next session, we'll focus on fixing the targeting alignment issues and implementing the weapon damage system to create a complete gameplay loop.
