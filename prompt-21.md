# Session 21: Completing AI Integration & Game Loop

## Progress from Session 20
In Session 20, we made significant progress converting FoodFight into a purely single-player experience:

1. Updated the player manager to support AI player type (adding `PlayerType` enum, `is_ai_player()` methods)
2. Enhanced the UI to properly label Player 2 as "AI OPPONENT" with visual distinction
3. Added missing AI functions in weapon_types.gd to support AI decision making
4. Fixed base placement initialization in game_state_machine.gd
5. Added proper callbacks and signal connections for AI logic
6. Implemented an AI thinking indicator to provide feedback during AI turns

## Current Issues
Though we've made progress, we still have issues to resolve:

1. Base placement doesn't properly work yet - buttons appear but clicking fails to place the base
2. Game doesn't properly transition through the game loop phases with AI
3. UI needs to be better synchronized with game state, especially during AI turns

## Tasks for Session 21

### 1. Finalize Base Placement
- Debug and fix the base placement click response
- Ensure weapon visualization shows a preview during placement
- Make AI properly place its base and trigger state transitions

### 2. Complete Weapon Placement Phase
- Verify player can place weapons on their territory
- Ensure AI properly places weapons on its territory
- Handle proper transition to targeting phase

### 3. Implement Targeting Phase
- Ensure player can select weapons and targets
- Make AI properly select targets for its weapons
- Handle attack resolution and damage calculation

### 4. Game Loop Completion
- Ensure proper round transitions after attack resolution
- Handle victory/defeat conditions
- Create post-game options (replay, quit)

### 5. AI Refinement
- Ensure the AI difficulty settings have meaningful impact
- Add proper logging of AI decisions for debugging
- Fine-tune AI to be challenging but fair

## Approach
We'll focus on one phase at a time, ensuring each phase works completely before moving to the next. Our priority will be on getting the full game loop working even with simple AI, then enhancing the AI afterward.

Since we now have the player/AI distinction working properly, our main focus will be on ensuring the game states transition correctly between human player turns and AI turns, with proper visual feedback throughout.
