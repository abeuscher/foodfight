# Sprint 2 | Phase 1: Phase Transitions and Game State Validation

## Project Description
**Food Fight** is a turn-based strategy game where players place bases and weapons on a grid-based game board, take turns targeting opponents, and resolve attacks to achieve victory. The game features a single-player mode with an AI opponent. The project emphasizes clean, maintainable code and a modular architecture to ensure scalability and ease of debugging.

---

## Sprint Description
This sprint focuses on completing the game loop with an AI opponent. The goal is to ensure smooth transitions between game phases, proper AI behavior, and a fully functional game loop. Debug output statements should be removed after resolving issues to maintain clean code. Quality is prioritized over speed, and solutions should be implemented properly, even if they take longer.

---

## Phase 01 Goals: Phase Transitions and Game State Validation
The first phase of this sprint focuses on ensuring that transitions between game phases (e.g., Base Placement, Weapon Placement, Targeting, Attack Resolution, Game Over) are smooth and error-free. The **PhaseManager** and **GameStateMachine** must work together seamlessly to manage the game's state and phase transitions. Debug output statements related to phase transitions should be removed after resolving issues.

---

## Objectives
1. **Verify PhaseManager Behavior:**
   - Ensure the `PhaseManager` correctly handles transitions and emits appropriate signals (`phase_started`, `phase_completed`).
   - Verify that the `PhaseManager` initializes each phase properly (e.g., Base Placement, Weapon Placement).

2. **Validate GameStateMachine Updates:**
   - Ensure the `GameStateMachine` updates the game state accurately during phase transitions.
   - Verify that the `GameStateMachine` emits events for state changes and updates the UI accordingly.

3. **Fix Bugs in Phase Transitions:**
   - Address any issues such as skipped phases, incorrect player turns, or improper initialization of components during transitions.

4. **Debug Output Cleanup:**
   - Remove debug output statements related to phase transitions after resolving issues to maintain clean and professional code.

---

## Coding Guidelines
- **Quality Over Speed:** Take the time to implement solutions properly, even if it takes longer.
- **Debug Output Cleanup:** Remove debug output statements after resolving issues.
- **Modular Design:** Ensure that components are modular and reusable.
- **Service Locator Pattern:** Use the `GameManager` to register and retrieve services.
- **Signal-Based Communication:** Use signals for communication between components to reduce coupling.

## Tasks and File Breakdown

### Task 1: Verify PhaseManager Behavior
**Objective:** Ensure the `PhaseManager` correctly handles phase transitions and emits appropriate signals.

**Files to Review:**
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\phase_manager.gd`
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\game_manager.gd`

**Code-Specific Notes:**
- Verify that the `PhaseManager` emits `phase_started` and `phase_completed` signals at the correct times.
- Ensure that the `PhaseManager` initializes each phase properly (e.g., Base Placement, Weapon Placement).
- Check that the `PhaseManager` interacts correctly with the `GameManager` and other components.

---

### Task 2: Validate GameStateMachine Updates
**Objective:** Ensure the `GameStateMachine` updates the game state accurately during phase transitions.

**Files to Review:**
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\game_state_machine.gd`
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\game_manager.gd`

**Code-Specific Notes:**
- Verify that the `GameStateMachine` emits events for state changes (e.g., `STATE_CHANGED`) and updates the UI accordingly.
- Ensure that the `GameStateMachine` interacts correctly with the `PhaseManager` and `BaseUIManager`.

---

### Task 3: Fix Bugs in Phase Transitions
**Objective:** Address any issues such as skipped phases, incorrect player turns, or improper initialization of components during transitions.

**Files to Review:**
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\phase_manager.gd`
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\game_state_machine.gd`
- `e:\FoodFightGodot\foodfight\scripts\states\game_manager.gd`

**Code-Specific Notes:**
- Test the game loop to identify any issues with phase transitions.
- Fix bugs related to skipped phases, incorrect player turns, or improper initialization of components.

---

### Task 4: Debug Output Cleanup
**Objective:** Remove debug output statements related to phase transitions after resolving issues.

**Files to Review:**
- All files modified during this phase.

**Code-Specific Notes:**
- Ensure that debug output statements are removed after resolving issues to maintain clean and professional code.

---

## Expected Deliverables
1. A fully functional `PhaseManager` that handles phase transitions correctly.
2. A `GameStateMachine` that updates the game state accurately during phase transitions.
3. All bugs related to phase transitions fixed.
4. Clean and professional code with no unnecessary debug output statements.

---

## Guidelines for Success
- **Collaboration:** Communicate with the team if you encounter blockers or need clarification on any task.
- **Testing:** Test the game loop thoroughly to ensure that phase transitions work as expected.
- **Documentation:** Document any remaining issues or areas for improvement for the next phase.

---

## Notes for Future Phases
- The next phase will focus on **AI Behavior and Turn Management**, ensuring that the AI opponent behaves as expected during its turn and interacts correctly with the game systems.
- Keep track of any dependencies or issues that may affect future phases.
